1. Distance problem:

Iterate the neighbours to find the next vertex. Do this until the last vertex then accumulate the edges.

2. Shortest path problem:

Implemented the Djikstra Shortest Path 

3. Possible routes problem:

Scanned vertex in a Depth First Search traversal method.

Solutions made in such a way that it follows the functional paradigm. However, collections are mutable to reduce complexity.
